## What is this?

A repo for my website: `kylieis.online`. I wanted to create a website that, unlike my more robust portfolio site at `kyliestewart.tech`, tells people who I am and what I do in a concise and straighforward format. I also want to optimize it for mobile viewing. I will accomplish this using primarily  `React` and `CSS`.
