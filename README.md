## What is this?

![this](https://github.com/kale-stew/mobile-portfolio/blob/master/src/assets/out.gif)

A repo for my website: [`kylieis.online`](https://kylie-is-online.now.sh/#/). I wanted to create a _very clean_ website that, unlike my more robust portfolio site at [`kyliestewart.tech`](https://www.kyliestewart.tech/), tells people who I am and what I do in a concise and straightforward format. I also want to optimize it for mobile viewing. I will accomplish this using primarily `React` and `CSS Flexbox`.
